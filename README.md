# TODO-List
Omega Prod TODO-List  
This is the [Omega Prod](https://discord.gg/hS4VgSTumn) discord server to-do list.  
All to-do items must be stored in the main folder in the .md format, and must contain infos about the Item (no empty item).  
If you want to attribute an Item to someone, go to attribution.md and put the name of the item in someone's row (be sure to put the new item AND the table modificaion in the same PR, it makes things a lot easier for us).  
If your item can be subdivided in sub-Items, we encourage you to do so by using the markdown task list. Please avoid making sub-items items by putting them in an independant .md file.
